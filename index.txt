           If you talk about the selection ratio then NEET is tougher as compared with JEE<b> . <br> 
            As in JEE 14 lakhs students appeared in the exam and approx 40000 students  got colleges as per there rank whereas in NEET 6 lakhs students appeared in this exam and and only 5000 students would be able to take admission.
<br>        <b>   NEET is a single eligibility cum entrance examination  <b>  namely 'National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for admission to MBBS/BDS courses' in each academic year. AIPMT was conducted by CBSE for selection of candidates for admission to 15% seats under All India Quota.

</div>


<br>
        <b> The Joint Entrance Examination<b> (JEE) is an engineering entrance assessment conducted for admission to various engineering colleges in India. It is constituted by two different examinations: the JEE Main and the JEE Advanced.

 <h2>The <b>Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA)<b> </h2>   conducts the joint admission process for a total of<b> 24 Indian Institute of Technology<b> campuses, <b>32 National Institute of Technology <b>campuses, <b>18 Indian Institute of Information Technology <b>campuses and<b> 19 other Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs)<b> based on the rank obtained by a student in JEE Mains and JEE Advanced.[citation needed]

There are some institutes, <b>such as the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology (RGIPT), the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)<b>, which use the score obtained in the JEE Advanced examination as the basis for admission. These institutes do not participate in the post-examination counselling session (JoSAA). Any student who takes admission to an Indian Institute of Technology cannot appear for the JEE Advanced examination again, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISERs, RGIPT, IIPE and IIST since they have separate and exclusive counselling sessions.

<div> 

          <h2> JEE Main </h2> <img src= 'jeemain.jpg' height=100px; width =100px> 

<p3>
        has two papers, Paper-I and Paper-II. Candidates may opt for either or both of them. Both papers contain multiple choice questions. Paper-I is for admission to B.E./B.Tech courses and is conducted in a Computer Based Test mode. Paper-II is for admission in B.Arch and B.Planning courses and will also be conducted in Computer Based Test mode except for one paper, namely the 'Drawing Test' which shall be conducted in Pen and Paper mode or offline mode. From January 2020 an additional Paper - III is being introduced for B.Planning courses separately.[1]

        JEE Main, unlike JEE Advanced, has a fixed exam structure and is not subject to change every year. Paper-1 is of three hours duration and consists of thirty multiple-choice (single-correct) questions in each of the three subjects (physics, chemistry and maths). 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and 1 mark is deducted for incorrect answers.

         A new pattern consisting of 20+5 questions per subject is introduced in January 2020 with 20 multiple choice questions + 5 numerical type question. In multiple-choice questions 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and no marks are deducted from numerical type questions.

          The top students who take the JEE-Main qualify for the JEE-Advanced examination.  Student who  secures a good AIR will get in to IIT's.

         <h2>The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test</h2>
                           <img src= 'neet.jpg' height= 100px; width =100px>

 <p4>
          (Undergraduate) (or NEET (UG)), formerly the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT), is an entrance examination in India for students who wish to study undergraduate medical courses (MBBS) and dental courses (BDS) in government or private medical and dental colleges in India.

          The undergraduate NEET (UG), for MBBS and BDS courses, is currently conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), which provides the results to the Directorate General of Health Services at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.[2] Prior to 2019, the test was conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in partnership with Prometric Testing Pvt Ltd headquartered in the US.[3]

          NEET-UG replaced the All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) and all individual MBBS exams conducted by states or colleges themselves in 2013. However, many colleges and institutes had taken a stay order and conducted private examinations for admission to their MBBS and BDS courses.</div>

          After the enactment of NMC Act 2019 in September 2019, NEET-UG became common all India entrance test for admissions to medical colleges in India including the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER) which until then conducted separate entrances.

               Exam pattern and structure:
                There are a total of 180 questions asked in the exam, 45 questions each from Physics and Chemistry, 90 questions from Biology. Each correct response fetches 4 marks and each incorrect response gets -1 negative marking. The exam duration is 3 hours (180mins). The exam is of 720 marks (maximum marks).



        The seat allotment for NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) UG 2020 will be on the basis of the AIR (All India Rank) secured in NEET and also basis the choices filled in the NEET Application form. A seat allocation list will hence be generated. This allocation list will be put on the official website of the Medical Counselling Committee (MCC).

<p10>


<b> Logo  </b> <br>
The design of the NCERT logo is taken from an Ashokan period relic of the 3rd century BCE which was found in excavations near Maski in Raichur district, Karnataka. The motto has been taken from the Isha Upanishad and means 'life eternal through learning'. The intertwined hansas symbolize the integration of the three aspects of the work of NCERT:
<br>
*Research and development<br>
*Training<br>
*Extension<br>


<b>Textbooks</b> <br>
Textbooks published by NCERT are prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) from classes I to XII, with exceptions for a few subjects. Around 19 school boards from 14 states have adopted or adapted the books. Online textbooks can be downloaded for free from the E-pathshala website.[4] Those who wish to adopt the textbooks are required to send a request to NCERT, upon which soft copies of the books are received. The material is press-ready and may be printed by paying a 5% royalty, and by acknowledging NCERT.[5]

The textbooks are in color-print and are among the least valuable books in Indian bookstores. Textbooks created by private publishers are priced higher than those of NCERT.[5] According to a government policy decision in 2017, the NCERT will have the exclusive task of publishing central textbooks from 2018, and the role of CBSE will be limited to conducting examinations.[6]
